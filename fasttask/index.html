    <p style="color: greenyellow ; font-size: 25px;">Jessore District (Bengali: যশোর, pronounced Jaw-shore, Anglicised: Jessore), officially spelled Jashore District from April 2018,[3][4][5] is a district in the southwestern region of Bangladesh. It is bordered by India to the west, Khulna District and Satkhira District to the south, Khulna and Narail to the east, and Jhenaidah District and Magura District to the north. Jessore is the capital of the district.</p>

    <p style="color:green ; font-size: 25px;">Jessore district was established in 1781. It consists of 8 municipalities, 8 upazilas, 92 unions, 1329 mouzas, 1477 villages and 120 mahallas. The upazilas are: Abhaynagar Upazila, Bagherpara Upazila, Chaugachha Upazila, Jessore Sadar Upazila, Jhikargachha Upazila, Keshabpur Upazila, Manirampur Upazila, and Sharsha Upazila.</p>
        
    <p style="color: rgb(214, 11, 28) ; font-size: 25px;">The district produces a variety of crops year-round. Date sugar, called patali, is made from the sap of locally grown date trees. It is cooked, thickened and crystallised using a traditional method. Patali is mainly produced in Khajura, but many date trees are cultivated in the Keshabpur Upazila and Manirampur Upazila areas. </p>
